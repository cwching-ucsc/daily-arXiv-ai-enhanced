To be published as a short paper accepted by the\n  24th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC)", "summary": "Adapting large, object-oriented C++ codebases for hardware acceleration might\nbe extremely challenging, particularly when targeting heterogeneous platforms\nsuch as GPUs. Marionette is a C++17 library designed to address this by\nenabling flexible, efficient, and portable data structure definitions. It\ndecouples data layout from the description of the interface, supports multiple\nmemory management strategies, and provides efficient data transfers and\nconversions across devices, all of this with minimal runtime overhead due to\nthe compile-time nature of its abstractions. By allowing interfaces to be\naugmented with arbitrary functions, Marionette maintains compatibility with\nexisting code and offers a streamlined interface that supports both\nstraightforward and advanced use cases. This paper outlines its design, usage,\nand performance, including a CUDA-based case study demonstrating its efficiency\nand flexibility."}

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight,\nbrain-inspired alternative that enables high parallelism but often suffers from\nlower accuracy on complex visual tasks. To overcome this, hybrid accelerators\ncombining HDC and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed,\nthough their adoption is limited by poor generalizability and programmability.\nThe rise of open-source RISC-V architectures has created new opportunities for\ndomain-specific GPU design. Unlike traditional proprietary GPUs, emerging\nRISC-V-based GPUs provide flexible, programmable platforms suitable for custom\ncomputation models such as HDC. In this study, we design and implement custom\nGPU instructions optimized for HDC operations, enabling efficient processing\nfor hybrid HDC-CNN workloads. Experimental results using four types of custom\nHDC instructions show a performance improvement of up to 56.2 times in\nmicrobenchmark tests, demonstrating the potential of RISC-V GPUs for\nenergy-efficient, high-performance computing."}

This evolution have led these systems to\nincorporate high-speed networks using faster links, end nodes using multiple\nand dedicated accelerators, or a advancements in memory technologies to bridge\nthe memory bottleneck. The interconnection network is a key element in these\nsystems and it must be thoroughly designed so it is not the bottleneck of the\nentire system, bearing in mind the countless communication operations that\ngenerate current applications and services. Congestion is serious threat that\nspoils the interconnection network performance, and its effects are even more\ndramatic when looking at the traffic dynamics and bottlenecks generated by the\ncommunication operations mentioned above. In this vein, numerous congestion\ncontrol (CC) techniques have been developed to address congestion negative\neffects. One popular example is Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification\n(DCQCN), which allows congestion detection at network switch buffers, then\nmarking congesting packets and notifying about congestion to the sources, which\nfinally apply injection throttling of those packets contributing to congestion.\nWhile DCQCN has been widely studied and improved, its main principles for\ncongestion detection, notification and reaction remain largely unchanged, which\nis an important shortcoming considering congestion dynamics in current\nhigh-performance interconnection networks. In this paper, we revisit the DCQCN\nclosed-loop mechanism and refine its design to leverage a more accurate\ncongestion detection, signaling, and injection throttling, reducing control\ntraffic overhead and avoiding unnecessary throttling of non-congesting flows."}

However, standard Federated Learning (FL),\na natural fit for this distributed task, struggles with performance degradation\nin accuracy and communication efficiency under the non-independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) data conditions inherent to these new\nenvironments. This paper proposes EPFL-REMNet, an efficient personalized\nfederated framework for constructing a high-fidelity digital twin of the 6G\nheterogeneous radio environment. The proposed EPFL-REMNet employs a\"shared\nbackbone + lightweight personalized head\" model, where only the compressed\nshared backbone is transmitted between the server and clients, while each\nclient's personalized head is maintained locally. We tested EPFL-REMNet by\nconstructing three distinct Non-IID scenarios (light, medium, and heavy) based\non radio environment complexity, with data geographically partitioned across 90\nclients. Experimental results demonstrate that EPFL-REMNet simultaneously\nachieves higher digital twin fidelity (accuracy) and lower uplink overhead\nacross all Non-IID settings compared to standard FedAvg and recent\nstate-of-the-art methods. Particularly, it significantly reduces performance\ndisparities across datasets and improves local map accuracy for long-tail\nclients, enhancing the overall integrity of digital twin."}

In this\ncontext, previous works highlighted the importance of ensuring efficient and\nresilient communication for the underlying consensus and replication\nmechanisms. However, they were mainly focused on mainstream,\nProof-of-Work-based Distributed Ledger Technologies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n  In this paper, the problem is investigated in the context of\nconsensus-validation based blockchains, like the XRP Ledger. The latter relies\non a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism which is proven to\nhave a good scalability in regards to transaction throughput. However, it is\nknown that significant increases in the size of the XRP Ledger network would be\nchallenging to achieve. The main reason is the flooding mechanism used to\ndisseminate the messages related to the consensus protocol, which creates many\nduplicates in the network. Squelching is a recent solution proposed for\nlimiting this duplication, however, it was never evaluated quantitatively in\nreal-life scenarios involving the XRPL production network.

Various methods emerged to\nmaster the measurement challenge in this huge address space, including\nhitlists, new probing techniques, and AI-generated target lists. In this paper,\nwe apply active Subnet-Router anycast (SRA) probing, a commonly unused method\nto explore the IPv6 address space. We compare our results with lists of active\nIPv6 nodes obtained from prior methods and with random probing. Our findings\nindicate that probing an SRA address reveals on average 10% more router IP\naddresses than random probing and is far less affected by ICMP rate limiting.\nCompared to targeting router addresses directly, SRA probing discovers 80% more\naddresses. We conclude that SRA probing is an important addition to the IPv6\nmeasurement toolbox and may improve the stability of results significantly. We\nalso find evidence that some active scans can cause harmful conditions in\ncurrent IPv6 deployments, which we started to fix in collaboration with network\noperators."}

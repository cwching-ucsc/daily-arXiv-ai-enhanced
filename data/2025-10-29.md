TL;DR: Grace is a satellite-ground collaborative system that enables near-realtime inference with large vision-language models (LVLMs) for remote sensing by running compact LVLMs onboard LEO satellites and larger LVLMs at ground stations. It uses asynchronous Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an adaptive archive update during short satellite-ground contacts and a confidence-based test to decide onboard processing versus offloading. Experiments on real orbital data show 76–95% average latency reduction versus SOTA while preserving accuracy.

Motivation: LVLMs can enhance remote sensing tasks (e.g., disaster monitoring) but are hard to deploy on LEO satellites because of constrained onboard compute, energy, memory, and brief satellite-ground contact windows. A system is needed to provide near-realtime LVLM inference while balancing latency, accuracy, and limited data-exchange opportunities.

Method: Grace uses a two-pronged design: (1) an asynchronous satellite–ground RAG pipeline where a knowledge archive is adapted and synchronized from ground to satellite with a tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited contact periods; (2) a confidence-based test/dispatch algorithm that decides per-task whether to run a compact LVLM onboard or offload to a more capable ground LVLM, aiming to meet latency and accuracy constraints.

Result: On experiments using real-world satellite orbital data, Grace reduced average task latency by 76–95% compared with state-of-the-art alternatives while maintaining inference accuracy (paper claims no accuracy compromise).

Conclusion: Grace demonstrates a practical satellite–ground collaboration approach to enable near-realtime LVLM-based remote sensing on LEO satellites. It presents promising latency improvements with preserved accuracy, though further details on model sizes, update bandwidth, thresholds, evaluation metrics and robustness would strengthen the work.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated great
potential in remote sensing (RS) tasks (e.g., disaster monitoring) conducted by
low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. However, their deployment in real-world LEO
satellite systems remains largely unexplored, hindered by limited onboard
computing resources and brief satellite-ground contacts. We propose Grace, a
satellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference
in RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime
inference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end
performance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous
satellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch
algorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite
archive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground
data exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that
either processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS.
Extensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that
Grace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art
methods, without compromising inference accuracy.

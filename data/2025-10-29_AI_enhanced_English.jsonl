However, their deployment in real-world LEO\nsatellite systems remains largely unexplored, hindered by limited onboard\ncomputing resources and brief satellite-ground contacts. We propose Grace, a\nsatellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference\nin RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime\ninference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end\nperformance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous\nsatellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch\nalgorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite\narchive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground\ndata exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that\neither processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS.\nExtensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that\nGrace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, without compromising inference accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Grace is a satellite-ground collaborative system that enables near-realtime inference with large vision-language models (LVLMs) for remote sensing by running compact LVLMs onboard LEO satellites and larger LVLMs at ground stations. It uses asynchronous Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an adaptive archive update during short satellite-ground contacts and a confidence-based test to decide onboard processing versus offloading. Experiments on real orbital data show 76\u201395% average latency reduction versus SOTA while preserving accuracy.", "motivation": "LVLMs can enhance remote sensing tasks (e.g., disaster monitoring) but are hard to deploy on LEO satellites because of constrained onboard compute, energy, memory, and brief satellite-ground contact windows. A system is needed to provide near-realtime LVLM inference while balancing latency, accuracy, and limited data-exchange opportunities.", "method": "Grace uses a two-pronged design: (1) an asynchronous satellite\u2013ground RAG pipeline where a knowledge archive is adapted and synchronized from ground to satellite with a tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited contact periods; (2) a confidence-based test/dispatch algorithm that decides per-task whether to run a compact LVLM onboard or offload to a more capable ground LVLM, aiming to meet latency and accuracy constraints.", "result": "On experiments using real-world satellite orbital data, Grace reduced average task latency by 76\u201395% compared with state-of-the-art alternatives while maintaining inference accuracy (paper claims no accuracy compromise).", "conclusion": "Grace demonstrates a practical satellite\u2013ground collaboration approach to enable near-realtime LVLM-based remote sensing on LEO satellites. It presents promising latency improvements with preserved accuracy, though further details on model sizes, update bandwidth, thresholds, evaluation metrics and robustness would strengthen the work."}}

We evaluate the trade-offs between beam directionality and\npointing tolerance across different Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite\ntrajectories and control strategies. The results link the hardware limitations\nto the communications performance, providing design guidelines for\nhigh-frequency Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) uplink under practical mechanical\nconstraints."}

Prior RDMA designs, like\nRoCE, IRN, and SRNIC, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying\non retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While effective\nfor general-purpose workloads, these mechanisms introduce complexity and\nlatency that scale poorly, where even rare packet losses or delays can\nconsistently degrade system performance. We introduce Celeris, a\ndomain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees\nbased on ML's tolerance for lost or partial data. Celeris removes\nretransmissions and in-order delivery from the RDMA NIC, enabling best-effort\ntransport that exploits the robustness of ML workloads. It retains congestion\ncontrol (e.g., DCQCN) and manages communication with software-level mechanisms\nsuch as adaptive timeouts and data prioritization, while shifting loss recovery\nto the ML pipeline (e.g., using the Hadamard Transform). Early results show\nthat Celeris reduces 99th-percentile latency by up to 2.3x, cuts BRAM usage by\n67%, and nearly doubles NIC resilience to faults -- delivering a resilient,\nscalable transport tailored for ML at cluster scale."}

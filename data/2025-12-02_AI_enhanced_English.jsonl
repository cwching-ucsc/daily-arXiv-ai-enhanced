In a typical multi-server FL architecture, the regions covered by different edge servers (ESs) may overlap. Under this architecture, clients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple ESs. Building on this observation, we propose a cloud-free multi-server FL framework that leverages Overlapping Clients (OCs) as relays for inter-server model exchange while uploading the local updated model to ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs without introducing new communication links. We derive a new convergence upper bound for non-convex objectives under non-IID data and an arbitrary number of cells, which explicitly quantifies the impact of inter-server propagation depth on convergence error. Guided by this theoretical result, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize dissemination range of each ES model among all ESs within a limited latency. To solve this problem, we develop a conflict-graph-based local search algorithm optimizing the routing strategy and scheduling the transmission times of individual ESs to its neighboring ESs.

However, existing benchmarks and datasets cannot address the complexities of such problems with dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints. To address this gap, we introduce NL4RA, a curated dataset comprising 50 resource allocation optimization problems formulated as LP, ILP, and MILP.

We focus on two approaches: (1) using an LLM in a zero-shot setting to directly assign user service requests to slices, and (2) formulating an integer programming model where the LLM provides semantic insight by estimating similarity between requests. Our experiments show that an LLM, even with zero-shot prompting, can produce a reasonable first draft of slice assignments, although it may violate some capacity or latency constraints. We then incorporate the LLM's understanding of service requirements into an optimization solver to generate an improved allocation. The results demonstrate that LLM-guided grouping of requests, based on minimal textual input, achieves performance comparable to traditional methods that use detailed numerical data, in terms of resource utilization and slice isolation.

However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Delta Sum Learning, an improved aggregation for Gossip (fully decentralized) Federated Learning, and packages it into an Open Application Model-based decentralized orchestration framework for edge deployment. Experiments show parity with alternatives at 10 nodes and a 58% smaller accuracy drop at 50 nodes, with logarithmic rather than linear accuracy degradation as topology size grows under limited connectivity.", "motivation": "Existing averaging-based aggregation in Federated and Gossip Learning reduces model accuracy and harms global convergence, especially as the number of edge nodes and limited connectivity grow. Also, deploying learning workloads at the edge lacks a declarative, intent-driven approach (e.g., Kubernetes manifests) that supports dynamic node discovery and multi-workload apps.", "method": "Propose Delta Sum Learning: a modified aggregation operator for Gossip Learning that operates on model deltas rather than simple averaging, designed to better preserve global convergence in decentralized peer-to-peer updates. Implement the approach within a decentralized orchestration framework using the Open Application Model to enable intent-driven, dynamic deployment and discovery of edge nodes and multi-workload applications.", "result": "On small topologies (10 nodes), Delta Sum performs on par with alternative integration methods. On larger topologies (50 nodes), Delta Sum yields a 58% lower global accuracy drop relative to alternatives. The method demonstrates stronger global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to linear loss for alternatives in limited connectivity settings.", "conclusion": "Delta Sum Learning is an effective aggregation alternative to averaging in Gossip Learning, improving scalability and robustness of global accuracy. Coupling it with an OAM-based decentralized orchestration framework enables practical, declarative edge deployment. The method shows particular advantage as topology sizes increase under connectivity constraints."}}

Specifically, vehicles need to exchange information with the road side unit (RSU). However, due to the varying vehicle speeds leading to different communication durations, the amount of data exchanged between different vehicles and the RSU may vary. This may poses significant safety risks in high-speed environments. To address this, we define a fairness index through tuning the selection window of different vehicles and consider the image semantic communication system to reduce latency. However, adjusting the selection window may affect the communication time, thereby impacting the AoI. Moreover, considering the re-evaluation mechanism in 5G NR, which helps reduce resource collisions, it may lead to an increase in AoI. We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization. Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization. We also provide a large language model (LLM) based algorithm.

This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Framework that adds application-aware routing flexibility for heterogeneous multi-hop Wi\u2011Fi IoT devices (ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi), using a proactive routing layer and a middleware with three strategies to influence paths or topology; validated via distributed neural-network inference experiments showing heterogeneity and topology strongly affect performance.", "motivation": "Traditional routing protocols are inflexible for IoT edge scenarios because they assume homogeneous devices and are agnostic to application-layer metrics and policies.

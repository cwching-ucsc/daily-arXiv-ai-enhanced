Abstract: As distributed optimization scales to meet the demands of Large Language
Model (LLM) training, hardware failures become increasingly non-negligible.
Existing fault-tolerant training methods often introduce significant
computational or memory overhead, demanding additional resources. To address
this challenge, we propose Memory- and Computation-efficient Fault-tolerant
Optimization (MeCeFO), a novel algorithm that ensures robust training with
minimal overhead. When a computing node fails, MeCeFO seamlessly transfers its
training task to a neighboring node while employing memory- and
computation-efficient algorithmic optimizations to minimize the extra workload
imposed on the neighboring node handling both tasks. MeCeFO leverages three key
algorithmic designs: (i) Skip-connection, which drops the multi-head attention
(MHA) module during backpropagation for memory- and computation-efficient
approximation; (ii) Recomputation, which reduces activation memory in
feedforward networks (FFNs); and (iii) Low-rank gradient approximation,
enabling efficient estimation of FFN weight matrix gradients. Theoretically,
MeCeFO matches the convergence rate of conventional distributed training, with
a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{nT})$, where n is the data parallelism size and
T is the number of iterations. Empirically, MeCeFO maintains robust performance
under high failure rates, incurring only a 4.18% drop in throughput,
demonstrating 5.0$\times$ to 6.7$\times$ greater resilience than previous SOTA
approaches. Codes are available at https://github.com/pkumelon/MeCeFO.

Abstract: Collaborative large language model (LLM) inference enables real-time,
privacy-preserving AI services on resource-constrained edge devices by
partitioning computational workloads between client devices and edge servers.
However, this paradigm is severely hindered by communication bottlenecks caused
by the transmission of high-dimensional intermediate activations, exacerbated
by the autoregressive decoding structure of LLMs, where bandwidth consumption
scales linearly with output length. Existing activation compression methods
struggle to simultaneously achieve high compression ratios, low reconstruction
error, and computational efficiency. This paper proposes FourierCompress, a
novel, layer-aware activation compression framework that exploits the
frequency-domain sparsity of LLM activations. We rigorously demonstrate that
activations from the first Transformer layer exhibit strong smoothness and
energy concentration in the low-frequency domain, making them highly amenable
to near-lossless compression via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
FourierCompress transforms activations into the frequency domain, retains only
a compact block of low-frequency coefficients, and reconstructs the signal at
the server using conjugate symmetry, enabling seamless hardware acceleration on
DSPs and FPGAs. Extensive experiments on Llama 3 and Qwen2.5 models across 10
commonsense reasoning datasets demonstrate that FourierCompress preserves
performance remarkably close to the uncompressed baseline, outperforming Top-k,
QR, and SVD. FourierCompress bridges the gap between communication efficiency
(an average 7.6x reduction in activation size), near-lossless inference (less
than 0.3% average accuracy loss), and significantly faster compression
(achieving over 32x reduction in compression time compared to Top-k via
hardware acceleration) for edge-device LLM inference.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent leaps in large language models (LLMs) caused a revolution in
programming tools (like GitHub Copilot) that can help with code generation,
debugging, and even performance optimization. In this paper, we focus on the
capabilities of the most recent reasoning models to generate optimized CUDA
code for predefined, well-known tasks. Our objective is to determine which
types of code optimizations and parallel patterns the LLMs can perform by
themselves and whether they can be improved by tutoring (providing more
detailed hints and guidelines in the prompt). The generated solutions were
evaluated both automatically (for correctness and speedup) and manually (code
reviews) to provide a more detailed perspective. We also tried an interactive
approach where the LLM can fix its previous mistakes within a session. The
results indicate that LLMs are quite skilled coders; however, they require
tutoring to reach optimized solutions provided by parallel computing experts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted
in networking research to address domain-specific challenges. However, their
quadratic time complexity and substantial model sizes often result in
significant computational overhead and memory constraints, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. Drawing inspiration from the efficiency and
performance of the Deepseek-R1 model within the knowledge distillation
paradigm, this paper introduces Mamba4Net, a novel cross-architecture
distillation framework. Mamba4Net transfers networking-specific knowledge from
transformer-based LLMs to student models built on the Mamba architecture, which
features linear time complexity. This design substantially enhances
computational efficiency compared to the quadratic complexity of
transformer-based models, while the reduced model size further minimizes
computational demands, improving overall performance and resource utilization.
To evaluate its effectiveness, Mamba4Net was tested across three diverse
networking tasks: viewport prediction, adaptive bitrate streaming, and cluster
job scheduling. Compared to existing methods that do not leverage LLMs,
Mamba4Net demonstrates superior task performance. Furthermore, relative to
direct applications of transformer-based LLMs, it achieves significant
efficiency gains, including a throughput 3.96 times higher and a storage
footprint of only 5.48% of that required by previous LLM-based approaches.
These results highlight Mamba4Net's potential to enable the cost-effective
application of LLM-derived knowledge in networking contexts. The source code is
openly available to support further research and development.

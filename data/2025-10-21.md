Abstract: Bootstrapping is a powerful statistical resampling technique for estimating
the sampling distribution of an estimator. However, its computational cost
becomes prohibitive for large datasets or a high number of resamples. This
paper presents a theoretical analysis and design of parallel bootstrapping
algorithms using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We address two key
challenges: high communication overhead and memory constraints in distributed
environments. We propose two novel strategies: 1) Local Statistic Aggregation,
which drastically reduces communication by transmitting sufficient statistics
instead of full resampled datasets, and 2) Synchronized Pseudo-Random Number
Generation, which enables distributed resampling when the entire dataset cannot
be stored on a single process. We develop analytical models for communication
and computation complexity, comparing our methods against naive baseline
approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed methods offer
significant reductions in communication volume and memory usage, facilitating
scalable parallel bootstrapping on large-scale systems.

Abstract: As distributed optimization scales to meet the demands of Large Language
Model (LLM) training, hardware failures become increasingly non-negligible.
Existing fault-tolerant training methods often introduce significant
computational or memory overhead, demanding additional resources. To address
this challenge, we propose Memory- and Computation-efficient Fault-tolerant
Optimization (MeCeFO), a novel algorithm that ensures robust training with
minimal overhead. When a computing node fails, MeCeFO seamlessly transfers its
training task to a neighboring node while employing memory- and
computation-efficient algorithmic optimizations to minimize the extra workload
imposed on the neighboring node handling both tasks. MeCeFO leverages three key
algorithmic designs: (i) Skip-connection, which drops the multi-head attention
(MHA) module during backpropagation for memory- and computation-efficient
approximation; (ii) Recomputation, which reduces activation memory in
feedforward networks (FFNs); and (iii) Low-rank gradient approximation,
enabling efficient estimation of FFN weight matrix gradients. Theoretically,
MeCeFO matches the convergence rate of conventional distributed training, with
a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{nT})$, where n is the data parallelism size and
T is the number of iterations. Empirically, MeCeFO maintains robust performance
under high failure rates, incurring only a 4.18% drop in throughput,
demonstrating 5.0$\times$ to 6.7$\times$ greater resilience than previous SOTA
approaches. Codes are available at https://github.com/pkumelon/MeCeFO.

Abstract: Collaborative large language model (LLM) inference enables real-time,
privacy-preserving AI services on resource-constrained edge devices by
partitioning computational workloads between client devices and edge servers.
However, this paradigm is severely hindered by communication bottlenecks caused
by the transmission of high-dimensional intermediate activations, exacerbated
by the autoregressive decoding structure of LLMs, where bandwidth consumption
scales linearly with output length. Existing activation compression methods
struggle to simultaneously achieve high compression ratios, low reconstruction
error, and computational efficiency. This paper proposes FourierCompress, a
novel, layer-aware activation compression framework that exploits the
frequency-domain sparsity of LLM activations. We rigorously demonstrate that
activations from the first Transformer layer exhibit strong smoothness and
energy concentration in the low-frequency domain, making them highly amenable
to near-lossless compression via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
FourierCompress transforms activations into the frequency domain, retains only
a compact block of low-frequency coefficients, and reconstructs the signal at
the server using conjugate symmetry, enabling seamless hardware acceleration on
DSPs and FPGAs. Extensive experiments on Llama 3 and Qwen2.5 models across 10
commonsense reasoning datasets demonstrate that FourierCompress preserves
performance remarkably close to the uncompressed baseline, outperforming Top-k,
QR, and SVD. FourierCompress bridges the gap between communication efficiency
(an average 7.6x reduction in activation size), near-lossless inference (less
than 0.3% average accuracy loss), and significantly faster compression
(achieving over 32x reduction in compression time compared to Top-k via
hardware acceleration) for edge-device LLM inference.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for speech transcription and synthesis,
leveraging edge-cloud parallelism to enhance processing speed and accessibility
for Kinyarwanda and Swahili speakers. It addresses the scarcity of powerful
language processing tools for these widely spoken languages in East African
countries with limited technological infrastructure. The framework utilizes the
Whisper and SpeechT5 pre-trained models to enable speech-to-text (STT) and
text-to-speech (TTS) translation. The architecture uses a cascading mechanism
that distributes the model inference workload between the edge device and the
cloud, thereby reducing latency and resource usage, benefiting both ends. On
the edge device, our approach achieves a memory usage compression of 9.5% for
the SpeechT5 model and 14% for the Whisper model, with a maximum memory usage
of 149 MB. Experimental results indicate that on a 1.7 GHz CPU edge device with
a 1 MB/s network bandwidth, the system can process a 270-character text in less
than a minute for both speech-to-text and text-to-speech transcription. Using
real-world survey data from Kenya, it is shown that the cascaded edge-cloud
architecture proposed could easily serve as an excellent platform for STT and
TTS transcription with good accuracy and response time.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As distributed machine learning (ML) workloads scale to thousands of GPUs
connected by ultra-high-speed inter-connects, tail latency in collective
communication has emerged as a primary bottleneck. Prior RDMA designs, like
RoCE, IRN, and SRNIC, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying
on retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While effective
for general-purpose workloads, these mechanisms introduce complexity and
latency that scale poorly, where even rare packet losses or delays can
consistently degrade system performance. We introduce Celeris, a
domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees
based on ML's tolerance for lost or partial data. Celeris removes
retransmissions and in-order delivery from the RDMA NIC, enabling best-effort
transport that exploits the robustness of ML workloads. It retains congestion
control (e.g., DCQCN) and manages communication with software-level mechanisms
such as adaptive timeouts and data prioritization, while shifting loss recovery
to the ML pipeline (e.g., using the Hadamard Transform). Early results show
that Celeris reduces 99th-percentile latency by up to 2.3x, cuts BRAM usage by
67%, and nearly doubles NIC resilience to faults -- delivering a resilient,
scalable transport tailored for ML at cluster scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Message Passing Interface (MPI) has been a well-established technology in the
domain of distributed high-performance computing for several decades. However,
one of its greatest drawbacks is a rather ancient pure-C interface. It lacks
many useful features of modern languages (namely C++), like basic type-checking
or support for generic code design. In this paper, we propose a novel
abstraction for MPI, which we implemented as an extension of the C++ Noarr
library. It follows Noarr paradigms (first-class layout and traversal
abstraction) and offers layout-agnostic design of MPI applications. We also
implemented a layout-agnostic distributed GEMM kernel as a case study to
demonstrate the usability and syntax of the proposed abstraction. We show that
the abstraction achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art MPI C++
bindings while allowing for a more flexible design of distributed applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Two-Phase Triple Modular Redundancy TMR divides redundancy operations into
two stages, omitting part of the computation during fault-free operation to
reduce energy consumption. However, it becomes ineffective under permanent
faults, limiting its reliability in critical systems. To address this,
Reactive-TMR (R-TMR) introduces permanent fault isolation mechanisms for faulty
cores, tolerating both transient and permanent faults. Yet, its reliance on
additional hardware increases system complexity and reduces fault tolerance
when multiple cores or auxiliary modules fail. This paper proposes an
integrated fault-tolerant architecture for interconnected multicore systems. By
constructing a stability metric to identify reliable machines and performing
periodic diagnostics, the method enables permanent fault isolation and adaptive
task scheduling without extra hardware. Experimental results show that it
reduces task workload by approximately 30% compared to baseline TMR and
achieves superior fault coverage and isolation accuracy, significantly
improving both reliability and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Recent leaps in large language models (LLMs) caused a revolution in
programming tools (like GitHub Copilot) that can help with code generation,
debugging, and even performance optimization. In this paper, we focus on the
capabilities of the most recent reasoning models to generate optimized CUDA
code for predefined, well-known tasks. Our objective is to determine which
types of code optimizations and parallel patterns the LLMs can perform by
themselves and whether they can be improved by tutoring (providing more
detailed hints and guidelines in the prompt). The generated solutions were
evaluated both automatically (for correctness and speedup) and manually (code
reviews) to provide a more detailed perspective. We also tried an interactive
approach where the LLM can fix its previous mistakes within a session. The
results indicate that LLMs are quite skilled coders; however, they require
tutoring to reach optimized solutions provided by parallel computing experts.

Abstract: Diagnosing GPU tail latency spikes in cloud and HPC infrastructure is
critical for maintaining performance predictability and resource utilization,
yet existing monitoring tools lack the granularity for root cause analysis in
shared computing environments. We introduce an eBPF-based telemetry system that
provides unified host-side monitoring of GPU workloads, correlating
eBPF-derived host metrics with GPU-internal events for holistic system
observability. The system achieves 81--88\% diagnostic accuracy, detects spikes
within 5 seconds, and completes root cause analysis in 6--8 seconds, operating
with 1.21\% CPU overhead at 100Hz sampling. Evaluated on distributed learning
workloads, the system identifies root causes including NIC contention, PCIe
pressure, and CPU interference, enabling operational debugging for multi-tenant
GPU infrastructure without requiring cluster-wide instrumentation.

Abstract: Language models are now prevalent in software engineering with many
developers using them to automate tasks and accelerate their development. While
language models have been tremendous at accomplishing complex software
engineering tasks, there are still many areas where they fail to deliver
desirable results, for instance code performance related tasks. Tasks like
optimization depend on many complex data from the environment, hardware, etc.
that are not directly represented in source code. Recent efforts have seen
large improvements in general code modeling tasks using chain-of-thought style
reasoning, but these models still fail to comprehend how the environment
interacts with code performance. In this paper we propose a methodology to
train language models that can interact with performance tools during their
reasoning process. We then demonstrate how this methodology can be used to
train a state-of-the-art GPU kernel optimization model.

Abstract: Recent work on distributed graph algorithms [e.g. STOC 2022, ITCS 2022, PODC
2020] has drawn attention to the following open question: are round elimination
fixed points a universal technique for proving lower bounds? That is, given a
locally checkable problem $\Pi$ that requires at least $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds
in the deterministic LOCAL model, can we always find a relaxation $\Pi'$ of
$\Pi$ that is a nontrivial fixed point for the round elimination technique [see
STOC 2016, PODC 2019]? If yes, then a key part of distributed computational
complexity would be also decidable.
  The key obstacle so far has been a certain family of homomorphism problems
[ITCS 2022], which require $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds, but the only known proof is
based on Marks' technique [J.AMS 2016].
  We develop a new technique for constructing round elimination lower bounds
systematically. Using so-called tripotent inputs we show that the
aforementioned homomorphism problems indeed admit a lower bound proof that is
based on round elimination fixed points. Hence we eliminate the only known
obstacle for the universality of round elimination.
  Yet we also present a new obstacle: we show that there are some problems with
inputs that require $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds, yet there is no proof that is
based on relaxations to nontrivial round elimination fixed points. Hence round
elimination cannot be a universal technique for problems with inputs (but it
might be universal for problems without inputs).
  We also prove the first fully general lower bound theorem that is applicable
to any problem, with or without inputs, that is a fixed point in round
elimination. Prior results of this form were only able to handle certain very
restricted inputs.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of Beyond 5G and 6G networks necessitates new
paradigms for autonomy and assur- ance. Traditional O-RAN control loops rely
heavily on RIC- based orchestration, which centralizes intelligence and exposes
the system to risks such as policy conflicts, data drift, and unsafe actions
under unforeseen conditions. In this work, we argue that the future of
autonomous networks lies in a multi-agentic architecture, where specialized
agents collaborate to perform data collection, model training, prediction,
policy generation, verification, deployment, and assurance. By replacing
tightly- coupled centralized RIC-based workflows with distributed agents, the
framework achieves autonomy, resilience, explainability, and system-wide
safety. To substantiate this vision, we design and evaluate a traffic steering
use case under surge and drift conditions. Results across four KPIs: RRC
connected users, IP throughput, PRB utilization, and SINR, demonstrate that a
naive predictor-driven deployment improves local KPIs but destabilizes
neighbors, whereas the agentic system blocks unsafe policies, preserving global
network health. This study highlights multi- agent architectures as a credible
foundation for trustworthy AI- driven autonomy in next-generation RANs.

Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to revolutionize industrial
operations and productions through utilizing Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
communications. Since each node in such environments generates various types of
data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance
to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes
are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of
two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT;
representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each
category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols
using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC
indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for
urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for
efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted
in networking research to address domain-specific challenges. However, their
quadratic time complexity and substantial model sizes often result in
significant computational overhead and memory constraints, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. Drawing inspiration from the efficiency and
performance of the Deepseek-R1 model within the knowledge distillation
paradigm, this paper introduces Mamba4Net, a novel cross-architecture
distillation framework. Mamba4Net transfers networking-specific knowledge from
transformer-based LLMs to student models built on the Mamba architecture, which
features linear time complexity. This design substantially enhances
computational efficiency compared to the quadratic complexity of
transformer-based models, while the reduced model size further minimizes
computational demands, improving overall performance and resource utilization.
To evaluate its effectiveness, Mamba4Net was tested across three diverse
networking tasks: viewport prediction, adaptive bitrate streaming, and cluster
job scheduling. Compared to existing methods that do not leverage LLMs,
Mamba4Net demonstrates superior task performance. Furthermore, relative to
direct applications of transformer-based LLMs, it achieves significant
efficiency gains, including a throughput 3.96 times higher and a storage
footprint of only 5.48% of that required by previous LLM-based approaches.
These results highlight Mamba4Net's potential to enable the cost-effective
application of LLM-derived knowledge in networking contexts. The source code is
openly available to support further research and development.

Abstract: Accurate positioning is a key enabler for emerging 5G applications. While the
standardized Location Management Function (LMF) operates centrally within the
core network, its scalability and latency limitations hinder low-latency and
fine-grained localization. A practical alternative is to shift positioning
intelligence toward the radio access network (RAN), where uplink sounding
reference signal (SRS)-based angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation offers a
lightweight, network-native solution. In this work, we present the first fully
open-source 5G testbed for AoA estimation, enabling systematic and repeatable
experimentation under realistic yet controllable channel conditions. The
framework integrates the NVIDIA Sionna RT with a Keysight PROPSIM channel
emulator and includes a novel phase calibration procedure for USRP N310
devices. Experimental results show sub-degree to few-degree accuracy,
validating the feasibility of lightweight, single-anchor, network-native
localization within next-generation 5G systems.

Abstract: The emerging road safety and autonomous vehicle applications require timely
and reliable data delivery between vehicles and between vehicles and
infrastructure. To satisfy this demand, 3GPP develops a 5G
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology. Depending on the served traffic type,
5G V2X specifications propose two channel access methods: (i) Mode 1, according
to which a base station allocates resources to users, and (ii) Mode 2,
according to which users autonomously select resources for their transmissions.
In the paper, we consider a scenario with sporadic traffic, e.g., a vehicle
generates a packet at a random time moment when it detects a dangerous
situation, which imposes strict requirements on delay and reliability. To
satisfy strict delay requirements, vehicles use Mode 2. We analyze the
performance of Mode 2 for sporadic traffic and propose several approaches to
improve it. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can increase
the system capacity by up to 40% with a low impact on complexity.

Abstract: 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) is a new technology developed by 3GPP to
support inter-vehicle communication. In contrast to 4G V2X which allows only
broadcast communication, 5G V2X enables groupcast and unicast communication.
Such types of communication are needed for new V2X scenarios: platooning,
extended sensors, remote driving, etc. To improve the data transmission
reliability and assist in the selection of the transmission parameters in these
scenarios, 5G V2X introduces a feedback channel that allows receivers to send
acknowledgments in response to data packets. However, some part of the overall
resource shall be allocated for the feedback channel, which reduces the amount
of channel resources available for data transmission. In this paper, we
consider a scenario with a platoon, which generates groupcast traffic, and
surrounding vehicles, which generate legacy broadcast traffic. Using extensive
simulations in NS-3, we analyze how the usage of the feedback channel
influences the overall system capacity. Our results show that depending on the
platoon size, groupcast, and broadcast traffic intensities, and their quality
of service requirements, the usage of the feedback channel can in some cases
significantly increase the system capacity (up to 2x), while in other cases it
almost halves the system capacity. We explain the reasons for such effects and
discuss how to adaptively select the feedback channel parameters.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in uplink distributed massive multiple-input
multiple-output networks is the sub-optimal performance of local combining
schemes, coupled with high fronthaul load and computational cost inherent in
centralized large scale fading decoding (LSFD) architectures. This paper
introduces a decentralized decoding architecture that fundamentally breaks from
the conventional LSFD, by allowing each AP calculates interference-suppressing
local weights independently and applies them to its data estimates before
transmission. Furthermore, two generalized local zero-forcing (ZF) framework,
generalized partial full-pilot ZF (G-PFZF) and generalized protected weak PFZF
(G-PWPFZF), are introduced, where each access point (AP) adaptively and
independently determines its combining strategy through a local sum spectral
efficiency optimization that classifies user equipments (UEs) as strong or weak
using only local information, eliminating the fixed thresholds used in PFZF and
PWPFZF. To further enhance scalability, pilot-dependent combining vectors
instead of user-dependent ones are introduced and are shared among users with
the same pilot. The corresponding closed-form spectral efficiency expressions
are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed generalized schemes
consistently outperform fixed-threshold counterparts, while the introduction of
local weights yields lower overhead and computation costs with minimal
performance penalty compared to them.

Abstract: We analyze the open-loop mechanical tracking performance of a sub-Terahertz
(sub-THz) and Terahertz (THz) uplink communication system. These high-frequency
bands enable multi-gigabit links through large bandwidths and narrow beams, but
require precise pointing to overcome spreading loss. A tracking system can be
used to orient horn antennas toward mobile targets. We develop a mathematical
model that captures the mechanical dynamics of a real tracking system, which
includes motion latency and acceleration and velocity limits, to quantify
pointing errors during satellite passes and integrate these effects into the
link budget. We evaluate the trade-offs between beam directionality and
pointing tolerance across different Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite
trajectories and control strategies. The results link the hardware limitations
to the communications performance, providing design guidelines for
high-frequency Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) uplink under practical mechanical
constraints.
